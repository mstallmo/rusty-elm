# Rusty Elm

A project exploring a functional based web application stack. This project is an expirament to see what it would be like to develop an application in static typed functional or functional inspired languages. While this may end up being a little unpractical the aim is to see what the world of web app development would be like with as little JS as possible. 

This application is a sample web based photoshop document editor that let's you render `.psd` files as well as select the visible layers of a specific document.

## Tech Stack
- Server (Rust)
- Front End UI (Elm)
- Photoshop Document Parser/Editor (Rust/Wasm)
- Bridge from Elm to Wasm (ReasonML)
